    <h2 id="h_01J6HVABGCJWCTJP2GNACKGDFH"><strong>6. Digital Currency Transfers</strong><a class="link-anchor" href="#h_01J6HVABGCJWCTJP2GNACKGDFH"></a></h2>
    <p><strong>6.1. In General.</strong> If you have sufficiently verified your identity, your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Supported Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Supported Digital Currency from, third parties by giving instructions through the BitVez Site. Your transfer of Supported Digital Currencies between your other digital currency wallets (including wallets off the BitVez Site) and to and from third parties is a “Digital Currency Transfer”.</p>
    <p><strong>6.2. Pending Transactions.</strong> Once a Digital Currency Transfer is submitted to a Digital Currency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Digital Currency Transfers that are initiated from a BitVez Account will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use on the BitVez platform or otherwise while the transaction is pending.</p>
    <p><strong>6.3. Inbound Digital Currency Transfers.</strong> When you or a third party sends Digital Currency to a BitVez wallet from an external wallet not hosted on BitVez (“Inbound Transfers”), the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network or miner’s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause an Inbound Transfer to remain in a pending state outside of BitVez’s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. By initiating an Inbound Transfer, you attest that you are transacting in a Supported Digital Currency which conforms to the particular BitVez wallet into which funds are directed. For example, if you select an Ethereum wallet address to receive funds, you attest that you are initiating an Inbound Transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. BitVez incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to unsupported digital currency sent to a BitVez Account or Supported Digital Currency sent to an incompatible Digital Currency wallet. Erroneously transmitted funds will be lost, and we take no responsibility for it. We recommend customers send a small amount of Supported Digital Currency as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of Supported Digital Currency. BitVez may from time to time determine types of Digital Currency that will be supported or cease to be supported.</p>
    <p><strong>6.4. Outbound Digital Currency Transfers.</strong> When you send Digital Currency from your BitVez Account to an external wallet (“Outbound Transfers”), such transfers are executed at your instruction by BitVez. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. BitVez shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a recipient of an Outbound Transfer. Digital Currency Transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. BitVez does not control the Digital Currency network and makes no guarantees that a Digital Currency Transfer will be confirmed by the network. We may refuse to process or cancel any pending Outbound Digital Currency Transfers as required by law or any court or other authority to which BitVez is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further BitVez Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.</p>
    <p><strong>6.5. Third Party Merchants.</strong> We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase from a third party (including other users of BitVez Digital Currency Services). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party using Digital Currency transferred using the BitVez Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify BitVez Support at <a href="https://support.bitvez.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://support.BitVez.com</a> so that we may consider what action to take, if any.</p>
    <p><strong>6.6 Debts.</strong> In the event that there are outstanding amounts owed to us hereunder, including in your BitVez Account, BitVez reserves the right to debit your BitVez Account.</p>

    <p><strong>7.1. Generally.</strong> In addition to the Services above, the following services ("Additional Services") may be made available by BitVez to users that fulfill certain eligibility criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>7.2 Staking Services.</strong> When you hold Digital Currencies on BitVez you may be given the option to “stake” these assets in a third party proof of stake network via staking services provided by BitVez. In a proof of stake network, transaction validators are chosen using a formula based on the amount of the underlying Digital Currency staked by the validator as opposed to computing power (i.e., proof of work). Please visit BitVez Site for further details on how proof of stake works.</p>
    <p><strong>7.3. Staking Service is Optional.</strong> Staking services may be made available to you by default for Digital Currencies where staking functionality is available on BitVez. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO STAKE WITH BitVez AND YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF BitVez STAKING SERVICES AT ANY TIME THROUGH THE SETTINGS PAGE IN YOUR ACCOUNT. Unless otherwise specified, if you opt-out of staking services, you can opt back in at any time with immediate effect.</p>
    <p><strong>7.4 The Service; Rewards; Commission; Limitations.</strong> (a) If you stake your assets with us, BitVez or one of its affiliates will facilitate the staking of those assets on your behalf, by acting as a transaction validator on the applicable network for the Digital Currency you stake. If BitVez successfully validates a block of transactions in that Digital Currency, you may earn a reward granted by that Digital Currency’s network. Your reward will be determined by the protocols of the applicable network. BitVez will distribute this reward to you after receipt by BitVez, minus a commission as determined by BitVez at the time. (b) Some Digital Currency networks subject staked assets to “slashing” if the transaction validator representing those assets incorrectly validates a transaction. BitVez will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your assets will not be slashed, but in the unlikely event they are, BitVez will promptly replace your assets at no additional cost. Some Digital Currency networks require that a certain amount of staked assets be locked (restricted from sale or transfer) for a certain period of time while staking. BitVez may also have additional sale or withdrawal limitations for particular staked assets if you are opted-in to staking.</p>
    <p><strong>7.5 No Guarantee of Rewards.</strong> You have no right to a reward until it is received by BitVez. Rewards will be distributed to your account promptly after they are received by BitVez. Unless otherwise stated, BitVez will use commercially reasonable efforts to stake any Digital Currencies for which you are using BitVez staking services. Unless otherwise specified, the “staking rewards rate” disclosed by BitVez for a particular Digital Currency is an annualized historical rate based on the staking rewards generated by BitVez in providing staking services to BitVez customers for that Digital Currency over the last 90 days. This rate is an estimate and changes over time. BitVez DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS, ANY SPECIFIC STAKING REWARD, OR ANY STAKING RETURN OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE STAKING REWARDS RATES.</p>

    <p><strong>10.2. Formal Complaint Process.</strong> If you have a complaint for BitVez (a “Complaint”), you agree to contact BitVez through our support team to attempt to resolve any such dispute amicably. If we cannot resolve the dispute through the BitVez support team, you and we agree to use the Formal Complaint Process set forth below. You agree to use this process before filing any arbitration claim or small claims action. If you do not follow the procedures set out in this Section before filing an arbitration claim or suit in small claims court, we shall have the right to ask the arbitrator or small claims court to dismiss your filing unless and until you complete the following steps.</p>
    <p><strong>10.2.1. Procedure Steps.</strong> In the event that your dispute with BitVez is not resolved through your contact with BitVez Support, you agree to use our Complaint form to describe your Complaint, how you would like us to resolve the Complaint, and any other information related to your dispute that you believe to be relevant. The Complaint form can be found on the BitVez support pages or can be requested from BitVez.</p>
    <p><strong>10.2.2. Our Response.</strong> We will acknowledge receipt of your Complaint form after you submit it. A BitVez customer service agent ("Agent") will review your Complaint. The Agent will evaluate your Complaint based on the information provided and information in the possession of BitVez.

    <p><strong>10.3. Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action.</strong> If we cannot resolve the dispute through the Formal Complaint Process, you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the BitVez Services, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the “Arbitration Agreement”). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer Rules.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf)</a>.</p>
    <p>This Arbitration Agreement includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.</p>
    <p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BitVez ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
    <p>The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement, any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, or any small claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law.</p>
