<p><strong>9. COOKIES </strong></p>
<p>9.1 Browser cookies are text files with small pieces of data downloaded onto your computer or mobile device. Browser cookies and other similar technologies (collectively called “Cookies”) enable websites and apps to store information or facilitate access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. These technologies are used by most website and app providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure security of the webpage or application, understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences and generally improve the user experience. When you use BitVez services, we may place cookies and similar technologies, (such as APIs, mobile advertising identifiers, tags and local storage) on your computer or other devices used to engage BitVez services. </p>
<p>9.2 We use Cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strictly Necessary purposes. Strictly Necessary Cookies are essential for our Services to function and therefore cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for security purposes, such as to prevent unauthorized access attempts. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies at any time, but some features of our Services may not work.</li>
<li>Performance purposes. We use these Cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services.

<li>Functional purposes. We use these Cookies to remember the choices you make (e.g. country or language selection) and to tailor our Services to your preferences.</li>
<li>Targeting purposes. We use first party and third-party cookies for advertising and measurement purposes. These advertising Cookies are used to serve personalized advertising on our Services or to serve advertising on other third-party sites that may be relevant to you or your interests. This means that after you have been to our Services, you may see advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet. These Cookies are also used to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The information collected through this process does not enable these third-party service providers to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you.

</ul>
<p>9.3 The length of time a Cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session Cookies will only stay on your device until you close your browser.
