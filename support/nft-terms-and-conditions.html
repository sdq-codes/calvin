<h1>1.&nbsp; Overview of the NFT Marketplace</h1>
<p>NFT means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data, such as digital collectible, media and art (“NFT Content”). The BitVez NFT Marketplace provides you with the opportunity to create, sell, purchase, collect, trade, showcase and otherwise transact NFT with other NFT Marketplace users and charges a transaction fee to facilitate these transactions. However, BitVez shall at no time be a party of these transactions and does not monitor the generation of any NFT, or verify the authenticity, legitimacy, identity of any NFT at the NFT Marketplace, or examine the nature and value of the NFT Content associated with such NFTs, or the existence of any encumbrances whereof.</p>
<p>For NFT Sellers: By minting, providing, or selling an NFT through the NFT Marketplace, you hereby represent and warrant that you own all legal right, title and interest in all intellectual property rights to the NFT Contentlinked or associated with such NFT, or you are legally authorized by the intellectual property owner to mint, provide or sell the NFT on the NFT Marketplace. Except for NFTs minted on the NFT Marketplace, in order to list any NFT for sale on the NFT Marketplace, you must first deposit the NFT for sale for custody with BitVez until such time as the NFT is sold or you decide to remove the NFT from the NFT Marketplace. For clarity, BitVez has no obligation or liability to you for keeping, storing, or helping you recover any NFT Content associated with your NFTs.</p>
<p>For NFT Buyers: When you purchase an NFT, you own the NFT that is associated with certain NFT Content, but you do not own any intellectual property rights in such NFT Content except for the license grants expressly set forth herein. In certain cases, we may help to evaluate or provide you with information about a seller of an NFT.However, such information is provided for informational purposes only. You bear full responsibility for verifying theauthenticity, legitimacy, identity of any NFT you purchase on the NFT Marketplace. We make no guarantees or promises about the identity, legitimacy, or authenticity of any NFT on the NFT Marketplace.</p>
